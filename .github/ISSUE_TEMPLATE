## Nope

This repository plans to follow the upstream OpenOCD repository; if you have
patches that fix various issues, please **do not** submit them here
since they'll most probably be ignored.

Instead, submit them to the upstream Gerrit server; for details please see the 
[Submitting patches to the OpenOCD Gerrit server](http://openocd.org/doc-release/doxygen/patchguide.html) page.
